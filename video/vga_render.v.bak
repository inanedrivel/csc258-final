 This module will retrieve the pixel data required for the
 controller, but it is a bit.. unconventional in how it does it.
 When requested for the pixel coordinates, this module will
 compute and find out the data required by retrieving the textures
 plus colour data from the memory. However, in our original model,
 timing issues occured since we only started accessing memory when
 the pixel needed to be drawn. We counter this by retrieving one line
 from memory at a time.
 
 This has some issues when starting, but due to the clock speed we don't
 really get any issues.
